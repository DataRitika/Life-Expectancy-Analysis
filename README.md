# Life-Expectancy-Analysis
This project explores global life expectancy trends using WHO data. I cleaned and prepared the dataset, handled missing values with group-wise and global strategies, encoded categories and scaled features. The analysis covers statistical insights, visualizations and correlation studies to identify major factors affecting lifespan, such as schooling, immunization, income composition and mortality rates. I used multiple machine learning models, compared their performance and applied SHAP for feature explainability. The project answers key policy-related questions and provides clear, visual results. It combines data science skills with real-world relevance, making it both insightful for research and practical for decision-making.
